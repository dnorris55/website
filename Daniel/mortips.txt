I. Introduction:

  Hello all you amateur Mordor DMs and hosts. Frustrated at something? See if any of these sections help. And if you wanted
to download the stuff just go to www.shareware.com and search for "Mordor". Thats how i found it :)

II. Getting Started

  After downloading your zip file (which btw the unzipped part takes up a rather large chunk of my hard drive) you should
unzip it in your main hard drive (usually C) in the folder C:\home\mordor. After a bit of waiting (i spent it thinking on 
what i was going to do once i got it running) and after all that, you run mordor.exe in /bin/95 (or /bin/nt, depending on OS)
and what's the first thing you see? A blank screen. How sad (joking.) Actually it is running at that moment. Use zMUD or 
telnet to log into it, using either your online ip or your local machine ip (i.e. 192.168.0.1, windows will tell you for 
sure...) and use Tesseract for now. His default password is always "dmname".

IIa. Why won't it load the rooms?

  Whats that? It won't load your rooms? (chuckle) Ok, i ran into that problem too. After several experiments, I found out
that it works best if you copy mordor.exe and editor.exe into your /players directory. Type "*shutdown 0" and restart mordor.
Does it work now? If it doesn't, e-mail to me at dnorris@zoomnet.net and ill see if i can help you any.

IIb. How do I make myself a DM?

  Two ways:

Way #1: Using Tesseract to make you some wierd thing by typing "*set p (target-char) c 15"

Way #2: Editing the mordor.cf file in the /bin directory, search for [DM's names] in it. Edit/add the char name of your
choice. Load the game, and when it asks for a password to create your char, enter NaZg0OL (if you havent written it down yet)

III. How to make items good

  I have found its best to use editor.exe to make both creatures and objects. The most important things in creature making 
is: 1. Name/desc/talk; 2. Keys (not as in a key to unlock a door but a key to use it (i.e. Zombie Man key1: zombie; key2: man
key3: <nothing> ) 3. Stats (adjust them to your personal pleasure) 4. Flags (type "*dm cflags" for more info)

IV. How to make shops good

  Ah, making shops now, are we? I'll tell ya what. Go to /docs/dm/ and look at dm.doc for more infomation. If you're not up
to searching, remember these steps:

Step 1: using "*c <item#>" to add the items in your inventory that youre going to add to the shop.
Step 2: using "*add r <any # above 7000>" to make a room.
Step 3: repeat step 2 except you must increase the room # by 1 (i call it a storeroom)
Step 4: using "*set x <exit> <your rm#>" to make an exit to the shop's room
Step 5: using "*save" to save that room (this step is important)
Step 6: setting an exit out to the host room like step 4
Step 7: Repeat step 5 in the shop's main room
Step 8: use "*t <shop's storeroom #>" to go there
Step 9: use "*set r f 13" to keep players from teleporting there and ruining your business :(
Step 10: use "*set o <object> f 9"
Step 11: repeat step 9 except replace flag #9 with flag #10
Step 12: drop the item
Step 13: If additional items, repeat steps 10-12.
Step 14: Use "*perm (item)"
Step 15: Repeat step 14 until all items are permed. Congrats! You have just made a store!

V. Getting additional help

  So, what i included in here didn't cover what you needed? E-mail to me at dnorris@zoomnet.net and ill see if i can help.
Afar from that, you're on your own.

VI. And what about making additional classes/races?

  You're on your own on that, buddy. I will tell you that you need a C compiler and to edit mordor.exe, and that you need to
make an additional flag(s) to be able to make training area(s) for that class. It is possable to make restrictions on those,
too. The sky (and your hard drive) is the limit! Have fun! - Shastao (dnorris@zoomnet.net)
