I. Introduction

  Hello there! You are probably new to TÐG so ill kick off things with teaching you how to
make that Ð. Type ALT+0208 (on the keypad) to make a Ð. Neat, huh?

II. The Basics

  Okay, when you become a member, you get level 50 access with merlin in Our Sovereign's
channel, #Meridian59 on CastleNet. Our meetings are at 7:30 pm US EST/EDT time on Monday and
may last for about 10-20 minutes. Don't dispair if you have plans during the meeting. Here 
at www.zoomnet.net/~dnorris/mordor/main.html you can ask for logs of meetings to be emailed 
to you too. The only reason as to why that is is because ANYONE can access our logs. 

III. Requirems

  There really aren't that many requirems to join TÐG. You must be at or above level 5, 
unless you are invited by the Sovereign or the Justicars.

IV. Ranks

  The ranking system in TÐG is as follows:

Sovereign (GuildMaster) = Shastao 
Justicar (2nd in command) = Mox, Gryphon, and Uberjedi
Lord (3rd in command) = Amorin, Shaitan, and ????
Members (4th in command) = Odds are, its you!

V. Restrictions

  The biggest (as of now) restriction is "No attacking your fellow members unless an agreed 
duel." Another one is "Ya can't be in any other guild" Others may follow in due time.

VI. Neat Stuff

  Okay, some of you might have skipped just to this section. In TÐG we get to go on hunting
parties, share secrets, share gold, and so on. A hunting party is when all of us gather
together and work on fighting things, etc. I promise to you that there will be more of these
events occuring.
