<P><A NAME="P2117"></A>528.  <B>Edward DORSEY</B> was born in 1619 in Anne Arundel,
MD.  He died on 2 Aug 1659 in Isle Of Kent, Anne Arundel Co., Md.  EDWARD DORSEY
<BR>
MARYLAND
<BR>
(1619-1659) 
<BR>

<BR>
&#147;No family of early Anne Arundel , Maryland is better known than the prolific
Dorsey family. More descendants have qualified for lineal-patriotic societies,
especially the Colonial Dames, than any other family in Maryland.&#148; 
<BR>

<BR>
Edward Dorsey entered Virginia sometime before October 7, 1646 from England.
His parents are not positively known. Many believe that the name Dorsey derived
from the ancient D&#146;Arcy, which can be traced at least as far back as 1332
in Old England. 
<BR>

<BR>
His beginnings were around the Lower Norfolk of Virginia where he was a shipwright.
He married Anne in Virginia in 1638. Not much is known about her. Some indications
give her last name as HOWARD although this has not been able to be proven. 
<BR>

<BR>
He and Anne arrived in Maryland as early as 1650 for he was granted a warrant
for 200 acres in Anne Arundel County and in 1651-1652 an additional 200 acres.
There is also some evidence that on May 4, 1655 he bought 300 acres from a Thomas
March. As a shipwright , he was an early industrialist &#147;and thus constructed
much needed watercrafts for the early planters along the Bay and the several
inlets on which he and the first settlers established their plantations.&#148;

<BR>

<BR>
He was not politically active, he was a non-conformist, with belief&#146;s coinciding
with the Puritans. As time went on he and his wife began to shift towards the
Quaker doctrine. &#147;In 1655 Elizabeth Harris, the proselyting Quaker, arrived
in Maryland and did a great deal of converting the non-conformists&#133;At a
Quaker meeting there were present &#147;Edw: Dorcy &amp; his wife&#148; (See
&#147;Quakers in the Founding of Anne Arundel County&#148;, by J. Reany Kelly
pp 15,17) 
<BR>

<BR>
Edward Dorsey drowned in the Bay on August 2, 1659. A petition was filed with
the Anne Arundel court on August 2, 1959 by a Thomas Hynson who had taken charge
of Dorsey&#146;s boat. No inventory was filed or recorded in Annapolis. On August
20, 1664, Dorsey&#146;s three sons were &#147;granted by Cecilius, Lord Baltimore,
Dorsey&#146;s plantation on Cabin Neck Branch of the south bank called &#147;Hockley-in-the-Hole&#148;.
Edward Dorsey&#146;s Grandson Caleb had the plantation resurveyed in 1685 and
found that &#147;Hockley-in-the Hole&#148; contained 843 acres instead of the
originally thought 400 acres. This helps substantiate the additional purchase
from Thomas March in 1655.
