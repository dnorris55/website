He fought in the French and Indian War under Capt Joseph Chapline....James was
educated by a Mr. Ross in Old Castle, County Meath, Ireland. He entered Trinity
College in 1724 at the age of 18. He took a BA degree from Trinity College-Dublin

Trinity College and the son of Isaac is the same James Henthorn who is our ancestor,
with only the proximity of time as evidence. Given the political climate of the
time in Ireland, would a man with a college education, a sign of some status
at the period come to America to become a blacksmith?

Clark Co, In, John Henthorn's death as 1820, Fayette Co, Pa, and he does not
list Susannah as a child.

<BR>
BIOGRAPHY: Isaac Henthorn, and his wife, moved from England to Ireland during
Cromwellian invasion/occupation in the late 1600s. They eventually had a son
named James, who graduated with a BA from Trinity College Dublin when he was
18, which would be in about 1720? Many people, including some Henthorns still
living near the Hamlet Henthorn in England, believe it is that James and his
brother John who were the first Henthorns to arrive in the American colonies.
